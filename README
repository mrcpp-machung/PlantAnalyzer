*** README for the PlantAnalyzer Python Sources ***

This are the python and C sources implemented for usage of the MRCPPS
(Machung Research Institute for Photosynthetic Pigments at Universitas Ma Chung, Malang)
low cost multispectral PlantAnalyzer.

While it may not be useful as is, for other projects unless you exactly copy
our setup, some of the code, especially the measurement class might be useful
for others too.

Prerequisites
=============

Honestly, I don't exactly remember all the additional Python Packages I installed...
But you are for sure going to need those:
    - opencv3
    - numpy
    - scipy
    - RPi.GPIO (Raspberry Pi specific package)
    - ConfigParser
    - argparse
    - cython
    - zipfile
    - gtk dev files (don't know the exact name of the package though...)


Installation
============

**Move the external executables to bin:**
    mv PlantAnalyzer/bin/* /home/pi/bin/.

this must also be done on the second Raspberry Pi!

**Edit analyzer.cfg:**
    change raspi2IP to the IP address of your second Raspberry

Now everything should work, but is obviously not calibrated. For Calibration see
_build/latex/PlantAnalyzer.pdf


Calibration
===========
**Stereo Calibration**
See the description of ``calibrate_stereo_cameras.py`` in _build/latex/PlantAnalyzer.pdf

**Depth Calibration**
To determine the parameters [depth map]/(a,b) have a look at the strategy described
in the accompanying paper Report.pdf

**Camera Parameters**
Can't help you there, just try which parameters for the shutterspeed, white balance
etc. work best for you and then put them in the [camera] section of analyzer.cfg
Same goes for [image processing]

Notes
=====

The Makefile is NOT an makefile for the python project, but only for the sphinx documentation!
For a more detailed overview about the System used see the Paper published at...
