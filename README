*** README for the PlantAnalyzer Python Sources ***

Prerequisites
=============

Honestly, I don't exactly remember all the additional Pythin Packages I installed...
But you are for sure going to need those:
    - opencv3
    - numpy
    - scipy
    - RPi.GPIO (Raspberry Pi specific package)
    - ConfigParser
    - argparse
    - cython
    - zipfile
    - gtk dev files (don't know the exact name of the package though...)


Installation
============

Move the external executables to bin:
    mv PlantAnalyzer/bin/* /home/pi/bin/.

this must also be done on the second Raspberry Pi!

Edit analyzer.cfg:
    change raspi2IP to the IP address of your second Raspberry

Now everything should work, but is obviously not calibrated. For Calibration see
_build/latex/PlantAnalyzer.pdf


Notes
=====

The Makefile is NOT an makefile for the python project, but only for the sphinx documentation!
For a more detailed overview about the System used see the Paper published at...
