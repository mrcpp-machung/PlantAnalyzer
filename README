*** README for the PlantAnalyzer Python Sources ***

Prerequisites
=============

Honestly, I don't exactly remember all the additional Python Packages I installed...
But you are for sure going to need those:
    - opencv3
    - numpy
    - scipy
    - RPi.GPIO (Raspberry Pi specific package)
    - ConfigParser
    - argparse
    - cython
    - zipfile
    - gtk dev files (don't know the exact name of the package though...)


Installation
============

**Move the external executables to bin:**
    mv PlantAnalyzer/bin/* /home/pi/bin/.

this must also be done on the second Raspberry Pi!

**Edit analyzer.cfg:**
    change raspi2IP to the IP address of your second Raspberry

Now everything should work, but is obviously not calibrated. For Calibration see
_build/latex/PlantAnalyzer.pdf


Calibration
===========
**Stereo Calibration**
See the description of ``calibrate_stereo_cameras.py`` in _build/latex/PlantAnalyzer.pdf

**Depth Calibration**
To determine the parameters [depth map]/(a,b) have a look at the strategy described
in the accompanying paper Report.pdf

**Camera Parameters**
Can't help you there, just try which parameters for the shutterspeed, white balance
etc. work best for you and then put them in the [camera] section of analyzer.cfg
Same goes for [image processing]

Notes
=====

The Makefile is NOT an makefile for the python project, but only for the sphinx documentation!
For a more detailed overview about the System used see the Paper published at...
